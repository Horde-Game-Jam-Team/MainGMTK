## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Content/Game/`  
  🔸 This is the **main game folder**.  
  All gameplay systems, levels, blueprints, and assets go here.

- `Content/Tests/`  
  🔸 This folder is for **your experiments, tests, or practice work**.  
  It's listed in `.gitignore`, so **anything here won't be tracked by Git**.  
  Feel free to create test blueprints, assets, or prototypes here without affecting the project.
- `Content/Game/Library/`  
  🔸 This folder is for **Static Work which does not have about any dependencies**.  
  It have sub folders for its own category **Making chanes here will affect the whole project**.
